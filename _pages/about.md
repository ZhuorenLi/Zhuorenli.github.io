<!-- 
👋 Greetings! I am Zhuoren Li. I'm a Ph.D. student at Tongji University, affiliated with the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles(TJU-IIV). I'm directly pursuing my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Prof. Lu Xiong](https://auto.tongji.edu.cn/info/1153/6446.htm) after obtaining my bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Tongji University. My co-advisors are [Prof. Jia Hu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=a34GvQoAAAAJ) and [Associate Prof. Bo Leng](https://auto.tongji.edu.cn/info/1169/9473.htm). -->

👋 Greetings! I am Zhuoren Li. I received my Ph.D. from Tongji University affiliated with the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles(TJU-IIV), under the supervision of Prof. [Lu Xiong](https://auto.tongji.edu.cn/info/1153/6446.htm) after obtaining my bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Tongji University. I am also privileged to be co-advised by Prof. [Jia Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=a34GvQoAAAAJ), Prof. [Nan Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_JnfJFoAAAAJ) and Assoc. Prof. Bo Leng.


🚀 I have been serving as the Student Director of the Intelligent Decision and Control Research Group at TJU-IIV. I lead the team in research on safe reinforcement learning, interactive decision-making, optimization-based motion planning and trajectory planning on unstructured roads. Additionally, I have been involved in 4 engineering projects, 7 government projects, and contributed as a key participant to more than 10 funding proposals.

📈 My current research interest includes Safe Reinforcement Learning for Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicles, Interactive Decision-Making, and Fundation Model Enhanced E2E Autonomous Driving, etc. 

I am currently seeking a postdoctoral position and would welcome opportunities to collaborate on research at the intersection of learning, planning, and safety.

📬 I’m always open to collaborations—please feel free to reach out!







<!-- 👋 Hi there! I’m Simeng Li, a data scientist with an engineering background and a master’s degree in business analytics from Boston University, where I completed my capstone project under the guidance of Professor Shawn Jin. During my studies, I gained practical experience in business analytics and led a cross-company collaboration as the PMO, guiding our team from data insights to implementation.

🚀 Currently, I’m a data mining engineer at a mobile gaming company, focused on increasing product visibility on Google Play. My work spans ASO (App Store Optimization), user acquisition strategies, machine learning model development, and recommendation system optimization, with guidance and collaboration from Professor Hao Fan at Wuhan University. To enhance workflow efficiency, I’ve developed tools like automated comment reply generation and sentiment analysis.

📈 My academic interests lie in recommendation systems and AI applications, especially in integrating large language models (LLMs) with traditional recommendation systems for more personalized experiences. I’m considering a PhD to further pursue these interests.

☕ Outside of work, I’m a coffee enthusiast and proud owner of a Chihuahua named “Coffee.” Looking forward to connecting over shared interests in data and tech! -->
