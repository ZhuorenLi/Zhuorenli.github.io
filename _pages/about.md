üëã Greetings! I am Zhuoren Li. I'm a Ph.D. at Tongji University, affiliated with the Institute of Intelligent Vehicles(TJU-IIV). I'm directly pursuing my Ph.D. degree under the advisor of [Prof. Lu Xiong](https://auto.tongji.edu.cn/info/1153/6446.htm) after obtaining my bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Tongji University. My co-advisors are [Prof. Jia Hu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=a34GvQoAAAAJ) and [Associate Prof. Bo Leng](https://auto.tongji.edu.cn/info/1169/9473.htm).

üöÄ Since 2020, I have been serving as the Student Director of the Intelligent Decision Research Group at TJU-IIV. I lead the team in studies on safe reinforcement learning, interactive behavior decision-making, and unstructured trajectory planning. Additionally, I have served as the technical director for 5 engineering projects, and I have also written more than 8 funding/grant proposals as a key participant.

üìà My research interest includes Safe Reinforcement Learning for Motion Planning of Autonomous Vehicles, Interactive Decision-Making, and Smooth Trajectory Planning, etc. I plan to finish my Ph.D. study in June 2025, and I'm looking for a post-doctoral position.








<!-- üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm Simeng Li, a data scientist with an engineering background and a master‚Äôs degree in business analytics from Boston University, where I completed my capstone project under the guidance of Professor Shawn Jin. During my studies, I gained practical experience in business analytics and led a cross-company collaboration as the PMO, guiding our team from data insights to implementation.

üöÄ Currently, I‚Äôm a data mining engineer at a mobile gaming company, focused on increasing product visibility on Google Play. My work spans ASO (App Store Optimization), user acquisition strategies, machine learning model development, and recommendation system optimization, with guidance and collaboration from Professor Hao Fan at Wuhan University. To enhance workflow efficiency, I‚Äôve developed tools like automated comment reply generation and sentiment analysis.

üìà My academic interests lie in recommendation systems and AI applications, especially in integrating large language models (LLMs) with traditional recommendation systems for more personalized experiences. I‚Äôm considering a PhD to further pursue these interests.

‚òï Outside of work, I‚Äôm a coffee enthusiast and proud owner of a Chihuahua named ‚ÄúCoffee.‚Äù Looking forward to connecting over shared interests in data and tech! -->
