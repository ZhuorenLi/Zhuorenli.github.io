### **Hybrid Action Based Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Compatible Autonomous Driving**
Collaborating student: *Guizhe Jin, 2nd-year Gruaduate Student*.

#### **Motivation**
- Coordinate both stability and flexibility of driving maneuver.
- Compating multi-attributes reward during RL policy training.
- Facilitating the policy exploration for finding global optimal solution.

Simultaneously considering the longterm discrete lane-change behavior goal and short-term realtime vehicle control. A hierarchical Reinforcement Learning method with a hybrid action space is designed to enhance driving stability and smoothness based on parameterized trajectory actions.

#### **Highlights**
- Designing a hybrid action structure including long-horizon behavior action and trajectory parameters, and short-horizon control command.
- Constructing a multi-critic approach to compat efficiency reward and safety reward during RL policy training.
- Proposing an epistemic uncertainty-based exploration strategy to improve sample efficiency and comprehensive learning performance.

### **Stability Enhanced DRL with Parameterized Trajectory Action**
Collaborating student: *Guizhe Jin, 2nd-year Gruaduate Student*.

#### **Motivation**
When DRL directly control the vehicle's motion:
- The output commands are easy to change continuously whent DRL agent directly generates the control command.
- The control commands generated in real-time are prone to sudden changes in dynamically changing environments due to the lack of long-term motion planning.

Simultaneously considering the longterm discrete lane-change behavior goal and short-term realtime vehicle control. A hierarchical Reinforcement Learning method with a hybrid action space is designed to enhance driving stability and smoothness based on parameterized trajectory actions.

#### **Highlights**
- Proposes a stability enhanced hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to achieve smooth and flexible driving behavior in dynamic traffic environment.
- Enables RL agent to participate in trajectory generation, where the trajectory parameter action is used to generate future motion path that adapt to various scenes.
- Realizes hybrid action output based on parameterized action space, hence the discrete and continuous actions have the optimal consistency.

#### **Some Reults**

The proposed hierarchical Reinforcement Learning method with hybrid Parameterized Trajectory Actions (RL-PTA) greatly reduces the ocsillation of the acceleration and steering command, while ensuring maneuvering flexibility and driving efficiency.
